He has been able to make thousands of small \u201cwiki\u2019s\u201d with his perspective on various topics, which has allowed him to see a change in his thoughts on certain issues over time. Caulfield believes there are two types of technologies. The \u201cGarden\u201d refers to the web, as there are vines, leafs, roots all connected as part of a greater garden, similar to how hypertext links one document to another. The \"Steam\u201d refers to how on social media instead of navigating our way around things from the outside, we just jump in and experience it first hand. He states \"Whereas the garden is integrative, the Stream is self-assertive. It\u2019s persuasion, it\u2019s argument, it\u2019s advocacy. It\u2019s personal and personalized and immediate. It\u2019s invigorating. And as we may see in a minute it\u2019s also profoundly unsuited to some of the uses we put it to.\u201d According to him, the memex is a representation of a garden, and was the groundwork of the web, however the memex differs  because it's not a publication platform, it's a recording platform, where you edit, annotate, share etc., but not publish. Blogging, he says, was half-hypertext, half forum and was the \u201cprototypical Stream\u201d (foundation). Social media platforms like Facebook/Twitter becomes your steam, as they become your context and your interface with the wider world. Caulfeild believes the web now is used to create conversational threads instead of an association of ideas, and that it is seen as a tool for self-expression rather than a tool for thought.

Tully points out how, prior to these telegraph cables, the speed of communication was restricted by the speed of transportation, however, with there introduction came a new era of faster than transportation communication. These projects began taking off after the success of the Transatlantic cable and, due to increased demand for them, there was a drastic increase in the farming of this gum known as gutta-percha. Gutta-percha was until that point largely used in medical and industrial products, like boots, ship keels etc. However after the discovery by a German engineer into its insulating properties, it began to be used by Britain in both above and below ground telegraph cables. \"It may be said that if gutta percha and its properties had not been known, submarine telegraph lines would perhaps never have been successful\". The sheer demand for longer and longer cables that up to 1/8th of there weight was from the gutta-percha. This demand was soon realized to be completly unsustainable, and with revelations that the trees would soon go extinct without intervension, drastic efforts were made to limit if not outright stop the \"slaughter\" of these trees. Thanks to a more sustainable approach being found and new chemical suppliments being implemented, the tree did not go extinct. The author concludes however that this was an early example of the danger of mass producation and huge demand that went mostly unchecked until the last minute, with governments turning a blind-eye to the farming approaches. </p>"},{"location":"Memex%20Eval.%202/Readings/A%20Victorian%20Ecological%20Disaster%20-%20Imperialism%2C%20the%20Telegraph%2C%20and%20Gutta-Percha%20%28John%20Tully%29/#links","title":"Links:","text":"<p>What do we use now?

These cables would allow them to connect through Spain to North America and through Portugal to South America, increasing German influence and prosperity and decreasing their reliance on there rivals Britain and France. As the author explains, this ambition sparked new contension between the three european rivals and thus was a particularly tense situation. Quevedo suggests that the reason behind the tension of these new cables was due to the following few factors: First, British companies had a monopoly in the North Atlantic on telegraph cables, and the intervenion of German cables would create competion and drive profits away from the British. Second, the cables would generate new income through coal resouces for Germany and thus empower their rival. And third, the German cables were a challenge to British naval dominance in the early 20th century, and would suggest a lack of power over the seas they claimed to control. The author concludes that this period is one of the most important \"moments\" in the years prior to the First World War, and despite France moving on from the matter by joining their cables with Germany's in 1910, it still represented unlieing tension the would boil over in the Great War. </p>"},{"location":"Memex%20Eval.%202/Readings/Telecommunications%20and%20Colonial%20Rivalry%20-%20European%20Telegraph%20Cables%20to%20the%20Canary%20Islands%20and%20Northwest%20Africa%2C%201883-1914%20%28Javier%20Ma%CC%81rquez%20Quevedo%29/#links","title":"Links:","text":"<p>Geopolitics Learning from the Past</p>"},{"location":"Memex%20Eval.%202/Readings/Telecommunications%20and%20Colonial%20Rivalry%20-%20European%20Telegraph%20Cables%20to%20the%20Canary%20Islands%20and%20Northwest%20Africa%2C%201883-1914%20%28Javier%20Ma%CC%81rquez%20Quevedo%29/#atlanticcable","title":"atlanticcable","text":""},{"location":"Memex%20Eval.%202/Readings/Telecommunications%20and%20Colonial%20Rivalry%20-%20European%20Telegraph%20Cables%20to%20the%20Canary%20Islands%20and%20Northwest%20Africa%2C%201883-1914%20%28Javier%20Ma%CC%81rquez%20Quevedo%29/#telegraph","title":"telegraph","text":""},{"location":"Memex%20Eval.%202/Readings/The%20Nazi%20Party%20-%20IBM%20%26%20%22Death%27s%20Calculator%22/","title":"The Nazi Party   IBM & \"Death's Calculator\"","text":""},{"location":"Memex%20Eval.%202/Readings/The%20Nazi%20Party%20-%20IBM%20%26%20%22Death%27s%20Calculator%22/#reference","title":"Reference:","text":"<p>Jones, G., Ballor, G., &amp; Brown, A.

Although they conclude that the Holocaust would have been carried out without IBM, the authors make it clear that IBM collaberation with the Nazis aided and escaleted the \"success\" of their plan. In the years that followed and even during that time, IBM's North American components turned a blind-eye towards the devastation, and esured questions were not asked as to their involvement. In the following years however, word began getting out about there support of the Nazi Party, and IBM began their process of rebuilding their reputation. In conclusion, the article states although they were not the source of the Holocaust, without IBM's support, the Nazi Party would not have been able to so systematically carry out their plans. </p>"},{"location":"Memex%20Eval.%202/Readings/The%20Nazi%20Party%20-%20IBM%20%26%20%22Death%27s%20Calculator%22/#links","title":"Links:","text":"<p>\"Death's Calculator\" Learning from the Past Geopolitics</p>"},{"location":"Memex%20Eval.%202/Readings/WHY%20OPEN%20SOURCE%3F%20Exploring%20the%20Motivations%20of%20Using%20an%20Openmodel%20for%20Hardware%20Development%20%28Warren%20Seering%20et.%20al%29/","title":"WHY OPEN SOURCE?

This model of combining knowledge and informaiton to come up with a better result stems all the way back to the original concept of the Memex, when Vannevar Bush believed in a pooling of information to improve humanities overall intelligence. This study suggests that there are two seperate motives for six interviewees (entrepreneurs), which were intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivations included personal satifaction, recognition etc., where as extrincic were the benefits to the company, mainly financial profit. As the authors explain, there are several reasons why open-source hardware companies are able to \"sustain themsevles\", these boil down to the increase in accessibility to the mchines, microcontrollers, resources etc. needed for these projects, as well as more organization in movements like the \"Maker Movement\".
