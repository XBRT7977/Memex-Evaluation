## Key takaways: 
This article reviews the history of the telegraph cables Germany wanted to put in Spain and Portugal. These cables would allow them to connect through Spain to North America and through Portugal to South America, increasing German influence and prosperity and decreasing their reliance on there rivals Britain and France. As the author explains, this ambition sparked new contension between the three european rivals and thus was a particularly tense situation. Quevedo suggests that the reason behind the tension of these new cables was due to the following few factors: First, British companies had a monopoly in the North Atlantic on telegraph cables, and the intervenion of German cables would create competion and drive profits away from the British. Second, the cables would generate new income through coal resouces for Germany and thus empower their rival. And third, the German cables were a challenge to British naval dominance in the early 20th century, and would suggest a lack of power over the seas they claimed to control. The author concludes that this period is one of the most important "moments" in the years prior to the First World War, and despite France moving on from the matter by joining their cables with Germany's in 1910, it still represented unlieing tension the would boil over in the Great War.
