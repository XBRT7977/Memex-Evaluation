## Reason for Choosing:
The trans-atlantic cable is to this day an extremely important part of human history, and perhaps the most influencial and relevent now-a-days. This relates well to the technological inovation and complex work in making these systems as we have discussed, as well as with any of these major projects, the key individuals involved in its development. 

## Key takaways: 
This article examines the laying of the Trans-atlantic cable and the impact it had on civilization at the time and to this day. The author states that most scholars agree that the Trans-atlantic cable is the "wire that changed the world", however, he believes there is more research to be done on the matter to truely understand "whose globalization are we talking about". Muller explains the cable did indeed enable instantaneous communication between America and Britain, with as many as 10,000 messages per day by 1900 being sent, but acknoledges that there were other cable projects at the time that recieved significantly less awareness and popularization (ex. West Indies). He also explains how although it was used heavily be governments and the media, for "99 percent of the population" the cable was out of reach, with the cost being far too high. The author concludes that although this was a momumental feet within history, there remains research to be done on those "un-observed" in it's completion.
