## Reason for Choosing:
This article relates to my other research because it analyzes the further development, particularly on the hardware side, of technology. As talked about in the reading, the importance in collective innovation is due to the tools, resources, and organization, which relates well to the early days of the internet, when without the collaberation in BellLabs and other research facilities, there may not have been the success that there is today. 

## Key takaways: 
This study analyzes the successes and failures of open-sourcing when it comes to hadware development. As we have seen, open source coding on the internet allows coders from across the world to work together on a project and through this collabration, more success can be achvievied. This model of combining knowledge and informaiton to come up with a better result stems all the way back to the original concept of the Memex, when Vannevar Bush believed in a pooling of information to improve humanities overall intelligence. This study suggests that there are two seperate motives for six interviewees (entrepreneurs), which were intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivations included personal satifaction, recognition etc., where as extrincic were the benefits to the company, mainly financial profit. As the authors explain, there are several reasons why open-source hardware companies are able to "sustain themsevles", these boil down to the increase in accessibility to the mchines, microcontrollers, resources etc. needed for these projects, as well as more organization in movements like the "Maker Movement". These allow for people with the know-how, tools, and organization to come together and collectively profit from their combined innovation.
