## Reason for Choosing:
This article is extremely relevant as it comes at a time when polarization and extremism on the internet and in society is at an all-time high in human history. While it seems as though we are more torn between ourselves than ever, regulations such as this in order to ensure that only true and factual information is spread could in fact save citizens from each other. The connection to the telegraph ties in nicely with the themes within this part of the course, and with readings from previous weeks as well.

## Key takaways: 
In this article, the author talks about the issue of regulation on the internet in our modern day. He uses examples throughout this article that relate back to the early days of the telegraph. With widespread communication between people across the world, citizens faced similar problems as they do today. Specifically citing several incidents that occurred in the 1930s and 40s, the author explains how the Telegraph in its early stages was also used for nefarious purposes. The author also explains how countries around the world, not just the United states, have been trying to implement types of regulations, citing the European Union and The United Kingdom, however acknowledges how none of these have been completely effective. Tying to the book he wrote, the author outlines four key steps to properly regulate internet usage. These four steps include 1. the implementation of a single regulator as opposed to a variety of agencies with varying roles, 2. the acknowledgment of the purpose of this regulator being the protection of freedom of expression and other fundamental rights, 3. the tools given to this regulator would be broad and vary depending on the situation as opposed to a “one size fits all”  approach, 4. the acknowledgment on behalf of the citizens that such regulation will not be perfect from day one and will require adjustment and tuning over the years to adapt to the needs of as many people as possible and to keep up with newer development in technology.
