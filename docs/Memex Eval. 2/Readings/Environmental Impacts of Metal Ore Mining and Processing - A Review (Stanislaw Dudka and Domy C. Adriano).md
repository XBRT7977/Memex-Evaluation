## Reason for Choosing:
This article ties into the envriomental aspects of several other of the readings I chose to include in this memex. As the enviroment is a crucial part of our daily lives and will only become more important as climate change ramps up, I felt is very appropriate to have more imforation about the massproduction of these IT resouces included.

## Key takaways: 
This article examines the ways in which the mining of metals, specifically copper, lead and zinc effect the enviroment. The authors state that Copper mining in particular produces large amounts of waste, especially compared to other industries, which contributes to the enviromental unfriendlyness of mining the material. Accoding to the authors, copper mining in particular is seriouly bad for the envrioment as "it generates more than half of all mine wastes and tailings produced in metal mining". This is troubling as copper is one of the most crucial components to the further development of communication technologies like telephone and internet wires. The trans-atlantic cables have enourmous amounts of copper in them, and the further production of such cables could spell enviromental disaster. On top of the large amounts of CO2, SO2, NO9 and more harmful gases copper mining produces, there have also been studies suggesting there are health risks from soil contaminations due to the mining as well. In conclusion, as governments look at ways to cut down on the production of CO2, a more effective  material to replace copper, or a way to recycle it to cut down on mining seems like and inevitable move.
