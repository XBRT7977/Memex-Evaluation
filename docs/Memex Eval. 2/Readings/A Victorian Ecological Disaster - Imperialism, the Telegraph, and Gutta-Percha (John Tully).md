## Reason for Choosing:
This article is perhaps the most relevent to our current situation that we have found ourselves in thanks to our lack of foresight and accountability. The ecological side of this article is a perfect connection to the problems we face with modern technologies are sparked many questions both about the technology of the time and of today.

## Key takaways: 
In this ariticle, Tully examines the darker side of the mass producation of gum used to house the massive submarine cables. Tully points out how, prior to these telegraph cables, the speed of communication was restricted by the speed of transportation, however, with there introduction came a new era of faster than transportation communication. These projects began taking off after the success of the Transatlantic cable and, due to increased demand for them, there was a drastic increase in the farming of this gum known as gutta-percha. Gutta-percha was until that point largely used in medical and industrial products, like boots, ship keels etc. However after the discovery by a German engineer into its insulating properties, it began to be used by Britain in both above and below ground telegraph cables. "It may be said that if gutta percha and its properties had not been known, submarine telegraph lines would perhaps never have been successful". The sheer demand for longer and longer cables that up to 1/8th of there weight was from the gutta-percha. This demand was soon realized to be completly unsustainable, and with revelations that the trees would soon go extinct without intervension, drastic efforts were made to limit if not outright stop the "slaughter" of these trees. Thanks to a more sustainable approach being found and new chemical suppliments being implemented, the tree did not go extinct. The author concludes however that this was an early example of the danger of mass producation and huge demand that went mostly unchecked until the last minute, with governments turning a blind-eye to the farming approaches.
