## Reason for Choosing:
After a number of lectures touched on the idea, I decided to more thoroughly examine the history. As this is a history course as well, I thought it was nesassary to truely understand the history about perhaps one of the most influencial and important technology companies of all time. 

## Key takaways: 
This article talks about the impact IBM had on the Holocaust and their collaberation with Nazi Germany. The authors examine the collaberation between the Nazi party and IBM's Germany branch, as well as Thomas Watson himself back in New York. They explain the methods used to catalogue and classify the German population as Jewish or not, as well as athe importance of the punch card, still a relatively new invention at the time, in identitying and tracking the Jewish population. Although they conclude that the Holocaust would have been carried out without IBM, the authors make it clear that IBM collaberation with the Nazis aided and escaleted the "success" of their plan. In the years that followed and even during that time, IBM's North American components turned a blind-eye towards the devastation, and esured questions were not asked as to their involvement. In the following years however, word began getting out about there support of the Nazi Party, and IBM began their process of rebuilding their reputation. In conclusion, the article states although they were not the source of the Holocaust, without IBM's support, the Nazi Party would not have been able to so systematically carry out their plans.
