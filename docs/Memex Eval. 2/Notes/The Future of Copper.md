As read in the [[Environmental Impacts of Metal Ore Mining and Processing - A Review (Stanislaw Dudka and Domy C. Adriano)]] article, copper, one of the most important parts of technology, is extremly bad both for the enviroment, and for humans. I wonder how companies like Apple, who claim to be transitioning to 100% sustainability are getting around this crutch, and how the rest of the industry will have to reshape the core of their products.
