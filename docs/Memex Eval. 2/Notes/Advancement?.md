After thinking more about about our the technologies we use now compared to say 100 years ago, I realized and understood what some people are saying. Technology companies have focused heavily on the development of new solfware (ie. the new OS, new video games, better graphics quality, faster load times etc.) but there hasn't really been much revolutionary new hardware. The new iPhone is more less the same as the old one, cars are seeing very minor tweaks in there software to be more user-friendly, the internet keeps expanding and getting faster to load, but there aren't any new incredible invensions to use it with. Even tech like VR or AR or HUDs have been in the works for years (if not decades) but seemingly continue to stall. If the 20th century was the century of physical (hardware) development, the 21st could be called the century of mental (software) development.
