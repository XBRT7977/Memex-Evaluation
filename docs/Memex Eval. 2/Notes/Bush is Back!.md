After reading "Why Open Source?", I couldn't help but think about Vannevar Bush and his initial ideas about the Memex being a tool for people to build off of each others discoveries and information. There is something similar about open-sourcing in general, where it allows people to basically access each others minds and see what they are thinking about a problem, which then has the potencial for each person to get smarter, and perhaps figure out how to solve the problem. It's cool to see how we are slowly moving towards a world of collaberation between the smartest, especially in the technology fields. Perhaps that Bush guy wasn't so dumb after all :)
