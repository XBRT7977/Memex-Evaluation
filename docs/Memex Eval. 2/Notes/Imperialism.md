The author states the cable made "imperialism possible where it was otherwise unlikely" (pg. 515). I believe what he means by this is that the rapid communication between Britain and it's colonies and it's military allowed it to "govern" them from far away. I wonder if the British empire would have been able to continue to expand past the late 1800's without the cable, and that would change where Canada is today.
