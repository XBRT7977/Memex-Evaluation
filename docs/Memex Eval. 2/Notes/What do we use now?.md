Tully talks a lot about how the tree would have gone extinct because of the huge demand for gutta-percha but that got me wondering, what are companies that are manufacturing ing large scale in-demand products. There are plenty of examples of mass produced "things", both technology and otherwise, that I'd be curious in researching how they've avoided enviromental disaster. Ex. Car tires, sylicone for chips, maple syrup :)
