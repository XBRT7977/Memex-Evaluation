It's interesting to see how the punch card system is used by IBM and by the Nazi's for such a terrible purpose. It just goes to show how technology isn't innocent, and can, without resistance, turn into really bad things. Maybe this relates to AI and machine learning, thats an important lesson for the future. If we're really intent on developing AI more, we need to put in place safegaurds and be careful of how we program it so it can't be used for the wrong purposes.
