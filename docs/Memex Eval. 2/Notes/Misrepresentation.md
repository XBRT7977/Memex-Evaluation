When reading through some of these articles it felt like I was reading through a piece of history, with the authors talking about the old days and how things used to be before the internet and before more technological advancement. Then it occured to me that most of these technologies are still be used today. We still have telegraph cables (phone lines) that allow us to communicate, trans-atlantic and undersea cables that are perhaps even more important now than "back in the day". It's funny to think about how people think we've advanced so much when the actual hardware is quite similar... oh wait... new note idea! -> [[Advancement?]]
