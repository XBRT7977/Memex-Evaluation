After reading the article on gutta-percha I thought also about not only the housing for the cables but also the wires themselves. The metal (ie. copper and other conducting materials) to manufacture these cables would have also had to be mined at a significantly increased rate due to the rapid demand for such services. Additionally, with the development of the internet, there is even more demand for these metals especially in large countries like Canada that need a variety of cables to traval hundreds if not thousands of kilometers. I wonder if the world will ever get to a point where we run out of some of these metals due to this demand, or if it has already happened or been prevented from happening.
