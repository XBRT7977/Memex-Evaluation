Reading through the Telecommunications and Colonial Rivalry article, I couldn't help but making connections to both the First and Second World Wars. The geopolitical rivalries and conflict between European countries was something unique to the pre-cold war era in human history. Whats also interesting is there was a reletive break from this type of conflict for over half a century until Russia invaded Ukraine last spring. Funny enough, this war is widely considered to be mostly due to Russia's interest in Ukraine's influence and resources, which is similar to the conflict discussed in the article, which was a fight for influence over African colonies and American trade, and the resources associated with them.
