As disscussed in "Why Open Source?", it is crucial that people collaberate on innovations especially in the technological fields. As has been talked about numerous times in class, from Enigma to the Atomic Bomb, to the development of the internet itself, there is never one person working by themselves in a backroom that comes up with this incredible innovation. This is more difficult today however, as mentioned in class, with the development of stricter copyright and patents restricting the collaberation between induviduals. Perhaps if we want to keep up the incredible technological innovation we have seen since the end of the Second World War, we need to reconsider how we work with one another.
