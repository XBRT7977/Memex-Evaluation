History is full of terrible things, but the reason for studying it is so that it doesn't repeat itself again. Technology companies are eqally if not more important in todays era that we must learn from the mistakes made by former companies like IBM to ensure the least damge possible in future conflicts. The importance of technology companies can been seen in the limiting of microchips to China, the restriction of similar systems to Russia due to their invasion, and many more. I suspect our reliance on technology will continue to into the future of conflict as well. Man why can't people just get along...
