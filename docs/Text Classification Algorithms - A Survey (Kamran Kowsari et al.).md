## Reason for Choosing:
This ariticle ties well in with the themes of classification and cataloging of information as well as the evolution of technology in aiding these processes. This type of classification take [[The "Amherst Method" - The Origins of the Dewey Decimal Classification Scheme (Wayne A. Wiegand)]] to the next level by harnessing the power of machine learning. 

## Key Takeaways:
The authors of this aritcle try various approaches to determine the usefulness of machine learning and artifical intelligence algorithms in classifying and sorting sets of data, particluarly documents and texts. The authors run through a mulitude of tests and conclude that the understanding of the current methods used for classification is important for the future of such technologies. They identify multiple important methods and existing algoithms in use suggest that AI could combine some of said algorithms to more efficently process the documents and texts being stored.
