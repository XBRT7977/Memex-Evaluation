## Key Takeaways:
Kumar examines the evolution of library catalogues from “clay tablets to the web-based”. He states that libraries have two main tools for finding information: classification and catalogue. He defines classification as the ability to arrange items on shelves in a “systematic order”. According to Kumar, catalogue is the ability to organize, identify and locate the documents with a system. The catalogue allows users to search for documents and locate them in the library by author name, date, subject, titles etc.
