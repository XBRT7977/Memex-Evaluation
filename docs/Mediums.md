Two interesting connections to the lectures:
1. A library in Rome was seen as a place to refine your taste. It's funny how the web was seen as a source of information in its eariler days but is now going back to a place to essencially confirm your view point, or in other words, "refine your taste".
2. Libraries reflect the world back on itself. This is also interesting because while the romans had libraries as their form of critizism we have the internet. It's also interesting that people get so frustrated with technology when all it's really doing it "reflecting ourselves back on us".
