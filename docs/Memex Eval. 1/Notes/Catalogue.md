Modern OPAC allows the user to access library catalogues outside the library, like the OPL (Ottawa Public Library) online catalogue. This system was initially developed by Dewey and allowed for the increased number of texts. It's a good thing too because there are now over 1.8 million texts in the [OPL collection](https://biblioottawalibrary.ca/en/aboutopl) that would be a nightmare without an effective catalogue to sort through them.
