Caulfield ends his article with a quote I really like, "Everybody wants to play in the Stream, but no one wants to build the Garden‚Äù. I like this because it shows how everyone is so caught up in their own opinion that they fail to see the potencial for the pooling of knowledge. It's almost like as a society we're back in the time before the internet when people like Vannevar Bush were brainstorming what a collective knowledge pool would be like. I wonder if we'll ever actually get there.
