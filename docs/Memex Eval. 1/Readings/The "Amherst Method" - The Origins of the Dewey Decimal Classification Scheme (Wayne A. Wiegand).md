## Reason for Choosing:
This article gives good background into the history of modern day library and internet searches and explains the backstory behind what I consider to be one of the most important steps towards the modern day web. 

## Key Takeaways:
The author of explains the beginings of the Dewey decimal classification scheme, which is now synomomis with modern day libraries. Dewey organized the New York State library's collection which was previously just organized completely alphabetically with no attention paid to the subject of the texts. Dewey organized these classes based on numbers, with further sub-classes  being assigned if nesassary using a second digit. This allowed for significantly more texts to be organized under the system and accounted for future texts because of his recognition of the infinity of decimals. He completed the system in 1875, and accredited much of the structure of the system to Amherst college and their world view. Dewey's new system was well timed as it was presented  at the beginning of the public library movement.
