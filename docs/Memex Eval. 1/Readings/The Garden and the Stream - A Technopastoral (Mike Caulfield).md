## Reference: 
Caulfield, Mike. 2015. 'The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral'.

## Reason for Choosing:
I really enjoyed this article and found the author does a really good job at defining the internet today. I think it ties in well with [[As We May Think (Vannevar Bush)]] by constrasting the almost "naivety" of Bush in believing the web would be a neutral place for information collection. 

## Key Takeaways:
Caulfield creates a personal wiki with links to similar topics to what he's exploring. He has been able to make thousands of small “wiki’s” with his perspective on various topics, which has allowed him to see a change in his thoughts on certain issues over time. Caulfield believes there are two types of technologies. The “Garden” refers to the web, as there are vines, leafs, roots all connected as part of a greater garden, similar to how hypertext links one document to another. The "Steam” refers to how on social media instead of navigating our way around things from the outside, we just jump in and experience it first hand. He states "Whereas the garden is integrative, the Stream is self-assertive. It’s persuasion, it’s argument, it’s advocacy. It’s personal and personalized and immediate. It’s invigorating. And as we may see in a minute it’s also profoundly unsuited to some of the uses we put it to.” According to him, the memex is a representation of a garden, and was the groundwork of the web, however the memex differs  because it's not a publication platform, it's a recording platform, where you edit, annotate, share etc., but not publish. Blogging, he says, was half-hypertext, half forum and was the “prototypical Stream” (foundation). Social media platforms like Facebook/Twitter becomes your steam, as they become your context and your interface with the wider world. Caulfeild believes the web now is used to create conversational threads instead of an association of ideas, and that it is seen as a tool for self-expression rather than a tool for thought. I like his closing idea: "Everybody wants to play in the Stream, but no one wants to build the Garden”.
