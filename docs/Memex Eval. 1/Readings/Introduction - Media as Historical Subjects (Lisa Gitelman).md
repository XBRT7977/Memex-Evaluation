## Reason for Choosing:
This aritcle connects well with [[The Garden and the Stream - A Technopastoral (Mike Caulfield)]] in explaining social media and how the interent is evolving past simply a place for people to put information. 

## Key Takeaways:
Gitelman believes that media is thought to be heading a certain direction, and that it is coherent and directional. She states that modernism is now “complete the stability and savability of inscriptions are qualities that arise socially as well as perpetually", and explains how she believes that modern day media is at the intersection of "authority and amnesia". Gitelman belives that media is more of its own being rather than simply a mix of the consumer and producer, and that these two catagories are "inadequate" to explain new media.
