## Reference:
Bush, Vannevar. 1943 'As We May Think' The Atlantic.

## Reason for Choosing:
I chose this ariticle because I find it to be central to not only this project but also to how the web started and is continuing today. 

## Key takaways: 
Bush believed that the memex requires a code view and a viewing mode (similar to what we see in Obsidian). In the code view, the links are made to other pages so people may navigate and build off of one another. In viewing mode, it simply appears as a special form of text that takes the reader to more information. The link allows for instant access to the linked document and all the information in it, which in Bush's mind, is like a pooling of knowledge between people. When multiple things are linked, they can be viewed in succession like "turning the pages of a book". A key point made by Bush is the memex does not expire, and can be passed on for others use in the future. The memex in Bush's mind is like a massive pool of information, knowledge and intelligence, that doesn't grow old, and can be accessed by anyone. 

## Links: 
[This website](https://history-computer.com/memex-guide/) gives a good description and background to the Memex. I particularily like the visual representation it gives of the Memex itself be essencially a desk on the outside, but with so much information on the inside.
