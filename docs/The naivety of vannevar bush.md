I like how Bush talks about the Memex as a sort of neutral machine. He gives the impretion that  people will use this thing to pool together their knowledge for others to get smarter with. It's funny because the internet these days can seem like anything but just information with so many opinions swirling around. People really like to get caught up in the steam.
