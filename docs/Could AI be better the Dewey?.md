After reading [[Text Classification Algorithms - A Survey (Kamran Kowsari et al.)]] it was clear to me that although the Dewey Decimal System is still in use, it has evolved substancially since its implementation. I wonder if AI could further some of the algorithms the article talked about like Term Frequency-Inverse document frequency, word-embedding etc. Would be trust a computor to completly control our flow of information though? Do they really know what we're looking for when we search?
